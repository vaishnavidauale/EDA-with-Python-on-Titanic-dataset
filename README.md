# EDA-with-Python-on-Titanic-dataset
I have tried to implement my data cleaning skills on the Titanic Dataset which is in csv format.
i have done exploratory data analysis using jupyter notebook and perform some data cleaning process to remove missing value.after that i used visualise library to get easy to understand
the dataset.and i get some insight from the data. i may later use this dataset for predicting survival rates using the test dataset.
